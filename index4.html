		<h3>Operation: Anchorage</h3>
		<p>The Brotherhood of Steel Outcasts have set up in the remains of the VSS Facility, a pre-War compound of Virtual Strategic Solutions, Inc., and are trying to unseal the door of the VSS Armory which they think contains advanced combat gear and weapons. The only way to unseal this door appears to be by surviving a military virtual reality simulation of Operation: Anchorage, and the only way to enter this simulation is via a computer interface device, like the Pip-Boy 3000.<br>So it comes down to the Lone Wanderer to go inside and complete a simulation of perhaps the greatest battle of the Fallout universe: the liberation of Anchorage, Alaska from occupying Red Chinese troops. The simulation is set during the Anchorage campaign, which occurred between June 2076, when the T-51b power armor was first introduced, and January 2077, when Chinese forces were completely driven out of Alaska. Evidence locatable in the Outcast Outpost makes it clear that the simulation is not an accurate recreation of the battle in many important ways; however, these ways are never detailed but are blamed on General Chase, who was the military correspondent for the simulation program.</p>
		<h3>The Pitt</h3>
		<p>In this add-on, the player character journeys to the industrial raider town called The Pitt, located in the remains of Pittsburgh. In contrast to Operation: Anchorage, The Pitt involves a more traditional quest line with several morally ambiguous choices. The main quest involves the player character taking on the role of a slave in order to investigate rumors that the raider boss of The Pitt has discovered a cure for mutations that have plagued many inhabitants of The Pitt.</p>
		<h3>Broken Steel</h3>
		<p>In this add-on pack, the Lone Wanderer joins the ranks of the Brotherhood of Steel to rid the Capital Wasteland of the Enclave remnants once and for all. The pack allows them to get to see the fruits of their father James' work, Project Purity's completion, and clean water flowing into the tidal basin for the first time in centuries.<br>Broken Steel's quest line is of the same length as the ones in Operation: Anchorage and The Pitt. Unlike those add-ons, in order to access the new story content from Broken Steel, the main storyline from the base game has to be finished.</p>
		<h3>Point Lookout</h3>
		<p>Point Lookout takes place in the Fallout equivalent of Point Lookout State Park, a new swampland area with new quests and enemies. Point Lookout in the Fallout setting has a landscape between one-sixth and one-fifth the size of the Capital Wasteland where "the bombs didn't actually fall, but the world has left it behind".<br>Like all add-ons (except for Broken Steel), Point Lookout is playable at any time during the main storyline; the player could travel there immediately after exiting Vault 101. Once the content is loaded, you receive a message on-screen that initially starts the quest The Local Flavor. As with previous add-ons, the main quest line is said to add about three to four hours worth of game time.<br>When you first arrive at Point Lookout, your permanent followers will not accompany you. If you have temporary followers in your party however, instead of proceeding straight from the boat to discover Pilgrim's Landing, you travel to any other marked location (e.g. Disaster relief camps) on the map and then fast travel back to the riverboat, you will be standing in front of the boat and be reunited with your temporary followers. This may prove helpful against the powerful attacks and high health of tribals or the swamp folks.<br>Unlike other add-ons, the player doesn't need to complete the main quest in order to travel back to the Capital Wasteland. Provided they can pay the ticket cost, the Duchess Gambit will travel back and forth anytime. It takes a month (30 days) of game time to travel to Point Lookout.</p>
		<h3>Mothership Zeta</h3>
		<p>In Mothership Zeta, an alien mothership abducts the Lone Wanderer, making the whole add-on take place onboard the alien ship in orbit around Earth.<br>Aboard the Mothership, the quest line is not completely linear and features some exploration. The Lone Wanderer will walk outside the ship into space and meet other abductees whom the aliens have captured over time.<br>The player character is able to return to the ship and use it as a "home-base" of sorts once the main quest is completed, although most of the ship will become inaccessible.</p>
