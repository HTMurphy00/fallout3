		<p id="background">Fallout is a post nuclear role playing game series created by Interplay. Although set in and after the 22nd century, 
		its story and artwork are heavily influenced by the post-World War II nuclear paranoia of the 1950s. The original two 
		games were developed by Interplay's RPG division (named Black Isle Studios during the development of Fallout 2) and 
		published by Interplay between 1997 and 1998. In 2004, Bethesda Softworks licensed the rights to develop three Fallout 
		games from Interplay. In 2007, they acquired the Fallout franchise entirely. In 2008, Bethesda released Fallout 3. 
		It was the first iteration of fallout that had been first person. It was a huge success. To try and maximize profit, 
		Bethesda outsourced the development of a spinoff game called Fallout: New Vegas to Obsidian, the same people 
		(different name) who created the original games. The next release was Fallout 4 in 2015. Fallout 4 VR is due to release 
		on December 12, 2017 and will be the first entry of a fallout game to delve into virtual reality. </p>
