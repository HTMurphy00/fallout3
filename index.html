		<p id="background">The series is set in a fictionalized United States in an alternate history scenario that 
		diverged from our reality following World War II. The transistor was not invented, while vacuum tubes and 
		atomic physics became the cornerstones to scientific progress, eventually achieving the technological 
		aspirations of the early Atomic Age and locking society into a 1950s cultural stasis. Thus, in this alternative
		atompunk "golden age", a bizarre socio-technological status quo emerges, in which advanced robots, 
		nuclear-powered cars, directed-energy weapons, and other futuristic technologies are seen alongside 
		1950s-era computers and telephones. The United States divides itself into 13 commonwealths and the aesthetics
		and Cold War paranoia of the 1950s continue to dominate the American lifestyle well into the 21st century, 
		leading to America becoming a fascist police state and ultimately abandoning its democratic ideals in favor of
		a deeply corrupt plutocratic system and capitalism. Political dissidents were sent to prison camps where they 
		were experimented on, and anyone who spoke out against the Enclave-controlled government, be they citizens or 
		occupied Canadians, were executed en masse in the streets.<br><br>

More than a hundred years before the start of the series, an energy crisis emerged caused by the depletion of petroleum
 reserves, leading to a period called the "Resource Wars" â€“ a series of events which included a war between the 
 European Commonwealth and the Middle East, the disbanding of the United Nations, the U.S. invasion of Mexico, as 
 well as the annexation of Canada, and a Chinese invasion and subsequent military occupation of Alaska coupled with
 their release of the "New Plague" that devastated the American mainland. These eventually culminated in the "Great 
 War" in the year 2077, a two-hour nuclear exchange on an apocalyptic scale, which subsequently created the post-apocalyptic
 United States, the setting of the Fallout world.<br><br>

Having foreseen this outcome decades earlier, the U.S. government began a nationwide project in 2054 to build fallout shelters
 known as "Vaults". The Vaults were ostensibly designed by the government contractor Vault-Tec as public shelters, financed by 
 junk bonds and each able to support up to a thousand people. Around 400,000 vaults would have been needed, but only 122 were 
 commissioned and constructed. Each Vault is self-sufficient, so they could theoretically sustain their inhabitants indefinitely. 
 However, the Vault project was never intended as a viable method of repopulating the United States in such a deadly scenario. 
 Instead, most Vaults were secret and unethical social experiments, and were designed to determine the effects of different environmental
 and psychological conditions on its inhabitants. Experiments were widely varied and included: A Vault filled with clones of a 
 single individual; one where the equipment designed to make clothing failed immediately after closing; a Vault where its 
 residents were kept in cryo-stasis; a Vault where its residents were exposed to psychoactive drugs; one where one 
 resident (usually the Vault's current Overseer) must be sacrificed each year; a Vault with only one man and puppets; a Vault 
 where its inhabitants were segregated; two with extremely disproportionate ratios of men and women; one filled with compulsive 
 gamblers who were only allowed to solve issues through gambling; a Vault where the inhabitants were exposed to the mutagenic Forced 
 Evolutionary Virus (F.E.V.); and a Vault where the door never closed, exposing the inhabitants to dangerous amounts of radiation. A 
 few control Vaults were made to function as advertised to contrast with the data from those Vaults with intentional flaws, but were 
 usually shoddily made due to most of the funding going toward the experimental Vaults. Nevertheless, many Vaults had their experiments
 derailed due to unexpected events. Many of these Vaults were so self-destructive that by the time other survivors 
 opened them, they were nothing but tombs.<br><br>

In the years following the Great War, the United States has devolved into a post-apocalyptic environment commonly dubbed "the Wasteland". 
The War and subsequent nuclear Armageddon has severely depopulated the country, leaving large expanses of property decaying from neglect. 
In addition, virtually all food and water is irradiated and most life have mutated due to high radiation combined with mutagens 
of varied origins. With a large portion of the country's infrastructure in ruins, basic necessities are scarce. Barter is the
 common method of exchange, with bottle caps providing a more conventional form of currency. Most cities and towns are
 empty, having been looted and deserted in favor of smaller, makeshift communities scattered around the Wasteland.<br><br>

Many humans who could not get into the Vaults survived the atomic blasts, but many of these, affected by the radiation, 
turned into so-called ghouls. While they were given an extended lifespan, many lost their hair and their skin decayed.
 Often, their voices became raspy, giving them a zombie-like appearance. Ghouls have a hatred towards humans either through 
 jealousy, or due to discrimination by humans. Almost all ghouls resent their comparison to zombies and being called a 
 zombie is viewed as a great insult by them. Eventually, after being exposed to high levels of radiation, some ghouls become
 feral ghouls and attack almost everything on sight, having lost their mind.</p>
