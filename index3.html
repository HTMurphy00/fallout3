<p>Main character creation occurs as the player experiences the character's childhood. The 
player decides the character's general appearance using a Gene Projection, conducted by 
the father before the mother dies. Afterwards, the father removes his surgeon's mask to 
reveal a face similar to the one chosen by the player for the character; your father's 
race will also be the same as your own no matter what. As a child in the Vault, the 
character receives a book titled "You're SPECIAL," whereupon the player can set the 
character's seven primary aptitudes. The character receives training weapons and a Pip-Boy
 3000 later on during childhood, and the player's performance in various tests determines 
 the rest of the attributes. Additionally, several quests inside the Vault are able to 
 influence the player character's relationship with his or her father. Skills and Perks 
 are similar to those in previous games: the player chooses three Tag Skills out of 13 to
 be the character's specialties. Five skills have been cut out from the game (Fallout and 
 Fallout 2 had 18 skills). First Aid and Doctor have been integrated into Medicine, Throwing
 and Traps have been merged into Explosives, Steal integrated into Sneak, and both Outdoorsman 
 and Gamble have been removed completely. The maximum level the player can achieve is level 
 20 (which is to be raised to 30 after purchase of the third DLC installment, along with
 the ability to continue your game after the main story missions are complete). The Traits
 from the previous Fallout installments were combined with Perks in Fallout 3, and the player
 can choose a new Perk each time after gaining a level.</p>

<p>The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, or V.A.T.S., is an active pause combat system implemented
 in the game. While using V.A.T.S., the otherwise real-time combat is paused. Attacks in V.A.T.S. 
 cost action points, and the player can target specific body areas for attacks to inflict specific 
 injuries. When attacks are selected, V.A.T.S. will then execute the attack in real-time slow motion, 
 allowing the gory deaths in the game to be shown in great detail. The player will take 90% reduced damage
 from enemies during this sequence. It should be noted that while the player has a 15% increased critical
 hit chance while using V.A.T.S., weapon degradation per shot is greatly increased, forcing the player to 
 strike a balance between using more ammunition or losing guns more quickly. This trade-off allows for two 
 very different play styles throughout the game.</p>

<p>A dynamic facet of gameplay is that firearms wear out over time of use. As a weapon degenerates, its damage
 is reduced and it loses accuracy. However, worn out firearms of the same type can be combined to make more 
 reliable and powerful weapons. Weapon schematics can also be found and used to create various devices such 
 as the Rock-It Launcher that can fire various items such as lunchboxes and stuffed animals, or the bottlecap 
 mine, made out of a Vault-Tec lunchbox, cherry bombs, lunchboxes and bottle caps. Along with equipping various
 weapons, the player can also utilize different armors and clothing that may have effects that can alter various 
 skills. For example, a pair of mechanic's coveralls may boost the player's repair skill while it is worn. Armor 
 and clothing come in two main parts for the head and body, allowing a player to wear different combinations of hats
 and armor as well as masks and facial clothing which can be worn with hats. Also, a player's inventory has a specified 
 weight limit, preventing a player from carrying too many items. Story-related or essential items like Ammunition 
 have no weight, due to the developer not wishing to bog down inventory management. Your weight limit will 
 increase if you increase your Strength stat in SPECIAL.</p>

<p>The player can have a maximum party of three, consisting of themself, Dogmeat, and a single non-player character. In 
addition to having Dogmeat in your party you are able to send him out on his own to search for items such as weapons
 and ammunition, radiation medicine, and stimpaks. Dogmeat can be killed during the game if the player misuses him or
 places him in a severely dangerous situations such as leading him into the Deathclaw Sanctuary. He cannot be replaced, 
 unless you have the Broken Steel add on, in which you can choose a perk allowing you to recruit Dogmeat's puppy. If 
 the player kills Dogmeat one can acquire two followers. Dogmeat and Dogmeat's puppies can be given stimpaks to heal them 
 if needed. In the PC version of the game, Dogmeat can then be resurrected via console commands and will continue with the 
 player unaffected. The player's party can further be extended, with several temporary quest non-player characters that will 
 stay with them until the quest related to the non-player character is completed, if their quest is never completed however,
 many will stay permanently with the player until killed.</p>

<p>The Karma system is an important feature in Fallout's gameplay. A player's actions, including conversation and combat choices, 
affects the player's status in the game world; a player who makes good decisions is received more positively by non-player 
characters, and a player that makes bad decisions has the opposite reaction. Crimes can also be committed by a player, and 
whichever faction or group that is harmed by a crime are fully aware of the player's action in most cases. Other factions 
that were not affected by the crime will not be aware of it, and since a town is usually its own faction, news of a crime 
committed in one town will not spread to another. Beware however, good or evil deeds will cause a bounty by the opposite 
alignment group. Talon Company (If you are good) or the Regulators (if you've been bad) will ambush you randomly, and are
 not bound to any particular area, they can appear anywhere in the wastes. Factions can range in size and boundaries, however, 
 and may not be restricted to a single area. The game world itself was planned to be significantly smaller than that of Oblivion's
 but is now similar in size.</p>

 <ul>
 <li>While Fallout and Fallout 2 feature turn-based combat and top-down isometric view in a 2-D engine, Fallout 3 features real-time combat and first or third person view in a 3-D engine. Fallout Tactics and the canceled Van Buren featured both turn-based and real-time combat and a top-down view.</li>
 <li>Perks and Traits have been merged. In Fallout and Fallout 2, Traits were chosen at character creation, and were commonly a combination of a powerful advantage and a potent disadvantage, where Perks were purely advantageous.</li>
 <li>In the SPECIAL character system, the number of skills have been reduced from 18 to 13, traits have been removed and perks are selected every level instead of every 3 to 4 levels.</li>
 </ul>
