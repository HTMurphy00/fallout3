		<p>The introductory sequence introduces the Lone Wanderer (player) to their character's father James, a 
		doctor and scientist in Vault 101. James frequently makes comments about the player character's deceased
		mother Catherine, and her favorite Bible passage, Revelation 21:6, which speaks of "the waters of life".<br><br>

The main quest begins after the player is forced to flee Vault 101 when James leaves the vault, throwing it into 
anarchy and causing the paranoid Overseer to send his security force after the player. The search for James takes
 the character on a journey through the Wasteland, first to the nearby town of Megaton, named for the undetonated
 atomic bomb at the center of town, then the Galaxy News Radio station, whose enthusiastic DJ Three Dog gives the
 player the moniker of "The Lone Wanderer". The player travels to Rivet City, a derelict aircraft carrier now 
 serving as a fortified human settlement. Here the player meets Doctor Li, a scientist who worked alongside the
 player's father. Doctor Li informs the player of Project Purity, a plan conceived by Catherine and James to 
 purify all the water in the Tidal Basin and eventually the entire Potomac River with a giant water purifier 
 built in the Jefferson Memorial. However, continued delays and Catherine's death during childbirth put an end 
 to the project, and James took the player's character as a newborn to raise them in the safety of Vault 101.<br><br>

After investigating the Jefferson Memorial, the Lone Wanderer tracks James to Vault 112, and frees him from a 
virtual reality program being run by the Vault's sadistic Overseer, Dr. Braun. James and the player return to 
Rivet City, and James reveals he sought out Braun for information on the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.),
 a device that contains the components needed to finally activate Project Purity. James and Doctor Li lead a team
 of Rivet City scientists to the memorial with intent to restart the project, but the memorial is invaded by the 
 Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from the remnants of the pre-War United States government. James
 floods the project's control room with radiation to stop the Enclave military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn,
 from taking control of it, killing himself (but Autumn survives), his last words urging his child to run. The 
 Lone Wanderer and Dr. Li flee to the ruins of the Pentagon, now a base for the Brotherhood of Steel and now known
 as the Citadel. With Project Purity still inoperational even with the Enclave occupying the site, the player 
 travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K. and finish James's work. The player finds the Vault to be a testing site
 for the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus), and the source of the Super Mutants in the Capital Wasteland. After the
 player acquires the G.E.C.K., the Wanderer is ambushed by the Enclave and captured.<br><br>

At the Enclave base at Raven Rock, the player is freed from their cell by the Enclave leader, President John Henry
 Eden, who requests a private audience with them. En route to his office however, Colonel Autumn defies Eden's orders
 and takes command of the Enclave military, ordering them to kill the player. Fighting their way to Eden's office, 
 the player discovers Eden is actually a sentient ZAX series supercomputer who took control of the Enclave after 
 their defeat in Fallout 2 on the West Coast thirty years ago. Eden wishes to repeat the plan of then-President Dick
 Richardson using Project Purity, infecting the water with a modified strain of FEV that will make it toxic to any 
 mutated life. This plan will kill most life in the wasteland including humans, but the Enclave, due to their genetic
 "purity" as a result of their isolation, will be immune and free to take control of the area. The Wanderer, provided
 with a sample of the new F.E.V., is given a choice to either leave peacefully or convince Eden to self-destruct the 
 entire base. The Lone Wanderer escapes Raven Rock and returns to the Citadel.<br><br>

With the knowledge they possess, the G.E.C.K. and the means to activate Project Purity, the Brotherhood assault the 
Jefferson Memorial, spearheaded by a giant robot named Liberty Prime. In the control room of Project Purity the player
 confronts Colonel Autumn, and has the choice to persuade him to give up or kill him. Dr. Li informs the player that 
 the purifier is ready to be activated, but the activation code must be input manually, and also that the control room
 is flooded with lethal amounts of radiation. The Lone Wanderer is forced to choose between sending Sarah Lyons of the 
 Brotherhood inside the extremely irradiated purifier or entering themselves. Whoever enters into the chamber inputs 
 the code hinted at through the game, that being 21:6, and dies from a radiation spike.<br><br>

If the "Broken Steel" DLC is installed, the player survives if they activate it themselves, but they also have 
the option of sending one of their radiation-immune companions to enter the code and start the purifier with no
 casualties. The player also has the possibility to enter the F.E.V. sample into the water prior to activation,
 having adverse post-ending effects on the game's side quests.</p>
